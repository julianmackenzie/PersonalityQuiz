# PersonalityTest

This was a project for CS251: Data Structures. It's a general personality test framework which allows
creators to input any prompts imaginable, map them to five different scores (OCEAN values), and select a
series of characters, personality type, or otherwise to compare the results to, even letting creators make a
brand new table of results out of their favorite fandom (mine was in the "mine" prompt, a test for which
Final Fantasy VII character you were most like).

It is simple, easy to use and build upon, and was a fun and applicable second project in that class.

Things I learned from this project:
1. It is beyond important to tailor a program to the user's experience. Though this project was a
simple command line quiz, its simplicity and ease of understanding was a grade requirement and was
half of the work.
2. This was the project where I learned about the map data structure! I had to use them more rigorously
later on, and even build my own from scratch near the end of the semester. This project got me ready for that.
3. I am most like a Kitten, Elsa from Frozen, and the Gonk Droid from Star Wars. Who'd have thought.
4. This was a big project for TIME MANAGEMENT. We had limited submissions and a strict deadline, and classes were
piling up. I procrastinated just a bit more than I should have and ended up having to work under pressure. Never again!
